# Spring Boot + React JS CRUD Example

In this full-stack tutorial, we will learn how to develop a simple full-stack web application that is a basic Employee Management Application using React, Spring Boot.  

The back-end server uses Spring Boot with Spring Web MVC for REST APIs and Spring Data JPA for interacting with the MySQL database. The Front-end side is made with React, React Router, Axios & Bootstrap.

# What we will build?  

# We will build a full-stack web application that is a basic Employee Management Application with CRUD features:
  Create Employee
  List Employee
  Update Employee
  Delete Employee
  View Employee
  
# Quick overview of React and Spring Boot
# What is React JS?
  React is used to build user interfaces (UI) on the front end.
  React is not a framework (unlike Angular, which is more opinionated).
  React is an open-source project created by Facebook.
# What is Spring Boot?
  Spring boot to develop REST web services and microservices.
  Spring Boot has taken the Spring framework to the next level. It has drastically reduced the configuration and setup time required for spring projects.
  You can set up a project with almost zero configuration and start building the things that actually matter to your application.
